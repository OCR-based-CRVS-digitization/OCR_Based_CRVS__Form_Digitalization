# What it does
This part of the code will be used to parse the pdf and send the fields to ocr.

# How to use it
We could not find an OCR API (yet) so we had to improvise
 - Install tesseract [here](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki)
 - install the dependencies `npm install`
 - run `python field_creator.py` to create a json file with all the field informtion
 - run the code `node app.js`
