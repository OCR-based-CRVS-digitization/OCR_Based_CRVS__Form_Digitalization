- [ ] install axios, make a request from chatgpt like hello world

- installed npm-tesseract-ocr
- installed tesseract.js

apparently there are online tools where we can draw bounding boxes and get the coordinates
we can export those coordinates as we like. chatgpt had this to say
```
Choose an Image Annotation Tool: There are several image annotation tools available online that allow you to draw bounding boxes on an image. Some popular options include Labelbox, RectLabel, VGG Image Annotator (VIA), and many more. Choose one that suits your requirements and is easy to use.
```

 - the previous coordinates don't work perfectly idk why
    - we need to find a way to get the coordinates of the bounding boxes
